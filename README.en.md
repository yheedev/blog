This is a personal technical blog developed using Next.js and TypeScript.

It documents projects I have worked on, debugging processes, studies based on lectures and books, and coding test solutions.

The blog supports multiple languages (Korean, English, and Japanese) and is developed with a focus on SEO optimization.
Blog posts are written in Markdown.
